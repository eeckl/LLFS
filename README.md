# LLFS (Lowie's LARBS Fixing Scripts)
This script fixes a common LARBS installation. LARBS is Luke Smith's bootstrapping script.
Why use this and why even bother?
* LARBS is meant for people with a US keyboard layout, when running this fixing script, your whole system has AZERTY keyboard layout compatibility.
* LARBS has not the best shell and X settings by default, this fixes that.
* Fonts are better and are fixed, when you run this script.
* LARBS creates unnecessary directories and files in ~, this script removes them.
With this fixing script you get a better LARBS experience!

Install and run the script simple and fast, with:
`curl -LO https://codeberg.org/8192/LLFS/raw/branch/master/fixlarbs.sh`
