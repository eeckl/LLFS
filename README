LLFS (Lowie's LARBS Fixing Script)
==================================
This script fixes a common LARBS installation. LARBS is Luke Smith's bootstrapping script.
Why use this and why even bother?
- LARBS is meant for people with a US keyboard layout, when running this fixing script, your whole system has AZERTY keyboard layout compatibility.
- LARBS doesn't have the best shell, X and MPD settings by default, this script fixes that.
- Better fonts and font sizes are chosen, and installed with this script.
- LARBS creates unnecessary directories and files in ~, this script removes them.
- This script changes some keybinds to some better and easier ones.
- Your home's subdirectories are efficiently handled with this script.
With this fixing script you get a better LARBS experience!

Warning:
Use the old version of the script to be sure things are working! The normal (new) version isn't tested yet!

I'll probably update this script every major LARBS release/update. If the script is broken, please contact me.

Installation:
`curl -LO tinyurl.com/fixlarbs`
