LLFS (Lowie's LARBS Fixing Scripts)
===================================
This script fixes a common LARBS installation. LARBS is Luke Smith's bootstrapping script.
Why use this and why even bother?
- LARBS is meant for people with a US keyboard layout, when running this fixing script, your whole system has AZERTY keyboard layout compatibility.
- LARBS has not the best shell and X settings by default, this fixes that.
- Fonts are better and are fixed, when you run this script.
- LARBS creates unnecessary directories and files in ~, this script removes them.
With this fixing script you get a better LARBS experience!

Installation:
curl -LO lowie.c1.biz/fixlarbs.sh
